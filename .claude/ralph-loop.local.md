Your job is to fix HackedServer so it supports ArcLight. You may use PacketEvents or any solution, but find a way to make HackedServer compatible with ArcLight (while keeping compatibility with existing software). Make sure to test that it works first by ensuring it loads correctly on the remote server logs, then using shard cli (Uxon account is now set up) to connect with various clients (NeoForge for example).
